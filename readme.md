# Try of making pygame game on my own

## Information

Space Ivaders first version game by Wiktor Byrka (WiktorB2004)

I know I made it not the best way (realised it in the process), but I wanted to check if I can code the game on my own (my first one without helping with tutorials), develop some project management skills and understand how to organize and write clean code

- ! I understood that I should think about the way I want to make my project instead of just writing the code.
- ! I understood how important is writing clean code and how to do it
